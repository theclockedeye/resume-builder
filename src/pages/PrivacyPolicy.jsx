      <h1>Privacy Policy for Resume Builder</h1>
      <p>Last updated: October 2023</p>

      <p>At Resume Builder, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our online resume creation tool. We believe in transparency and simplicity, so we've kept this policy straightforward and easy to understand.</p>

      <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We only collect the resume data that you voluntarily enter into our tool. This includes basic personal information such as your name, contact details, work experience, education history, skills, and any other content you add to build your resume. We do not collect sensitive logs, browsing history, IP addresses, or any other data beyond what you explicitly provide for creating your professional resume.</p>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>Our website uses cookies to improve your experience. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us remember your preferences, such as template choices or color settings. We may also use cookies for analytics to understand how our tool is used, which helps us improve it. You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings at any time.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use Google AdSense to display relevant advertisements on our site. Google AdSense may collect information about your visits to this website and others to show you ads that might interest you. This data collection is governed by Google's own privacy policy, which you can review at policies.google.com/privacy. We do not share your resume data with Google or any other third parties.</p>

      <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p>Your privacy and security are our top priorities. All resume data is stored locally in your web browser and never sent to our servers or external databases. This means your information stays on your device unless you choose to export it (for example, as a PDF). We implement reasonable security measures to protect our website, but remember that no online tool is completely immune to risks.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>You have full control over your resume data. You can access, edit, or delete it at any time while using our tool. Since everything is stored locally, you can also clear your browser data to remove all saved information. If you have questions about your data or want to exercise your rights, we're here to help.</p>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have any concerns about your privacy, this policy, or how we handle your information, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can contact us at privacy@resumebuilder.com. We'll respond to your inquiries as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. We'll notify users of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
